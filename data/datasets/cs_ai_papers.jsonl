{"text": "Title: RLBFF: Binary Flexible Feedback to bridge between Human Feedback & Verifiable Rewards\nAbstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost)."}

Our approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step generation. We introduce two key innovations: \"timestep sharing\" to reduce gradient noise and \"split-timestep fine-tuning\" to improve prompt alignment. Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly accessible for practical deployment."}
{"text": "Title: SAGE: A Realistic Benchmark for Semantic Understanding\nAbstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE (Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories: Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity, Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of 0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of model robustness for real-world deployment."}
{"text": "Title: No Prior, No Leakage: Revisiting Reconstruction Attacks in Trained Neural Networks\nAbstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions, portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set, rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance. Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks. Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact, less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need for strong generalization in this setting."}
{"text": "Title: Optimal Robust Recourse with $L^p$-Bounded Model Change\nAbstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment, invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models), most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm. However, using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\\geq 1$ but $p\\neq \\infty$, and provide a new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility."}

However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically, considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/."}
{"text": "Title: DisCoCLIP: A Distributional Compositional Tensor Network Encoder for Vision-Language Understanding\nAbstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%, boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves 93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks."}
{"text": "Title: It's Not You, It's Clipping: A Soft Trust-Region via Probability Smoothing for LLM RL\nAbstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees. We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO (single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B)."}
{"text": "Title: Taxonomy-aware Dynamic Motion Generation on Hyperbolic Manifolds\nAbstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural information about how movements relate to one another, this information is frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This paper introduces the \\ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories."}
{"text": "Title: Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image Composition?\nAbstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

{"text": "Title: Data-Centric Elastic Pipeline Parallelism for Efficient Long-Context LLM Training\nAbstract: Long context training is crucial for LLM's context extension. Existing schemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication overhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness hinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples exhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level PP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur hardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP granularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence length distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a challenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP scheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism (EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource and workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system that unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and workload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short ones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline schedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware chunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems."}
{"text": "Title: SuperOffload: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale LLM Training on Superchips\nAbstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package, which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently. SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems, enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of 13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while achieving 55% MFU."}
{"text": "Title: Grounding AI Explanations in Experience: A Reflective Cognitive Architecture for Clinical Decision Support\nAbstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives, often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\\% over the baseline but, more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced, highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision support systems.

{"text": "Title: MedVSR: Medical Video Super-Resolution with Cross State-Space Propagation\nAbstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints. Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake, noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models, enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in reconstruction performance and efficiency.

Achieving accurate and scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning."}
{"text": "Title: Semantic Edge-Cloud Communication for Real-Time Urban Traffic Surveillance with ViT and LLMs over Mobile Networks\nAbstract: Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance."}
{"text": "Title: Instruction-tuned Self-Questioning Framework for Multimodal Reasoning\nAbstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs). However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs. To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP, which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture. Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate reasoning than the previous works."}
{"text": "Title: Federated Flow Matching\nAbstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization. This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT, which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance comparable to the centralized baseline."}

While foundation models have revolutionized natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction, anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.

{"text": "Title: Hunyuan3D-Omni: A Unified Framework for Controllable Generation of 3D Assets\nAbstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images, Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows."}

However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge. This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer (CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts. This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI."}
{"text": "Title: Tree Search for LLM Agent Reinforcement Learning\nAbstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based RL method."}
{"text": "Title: What Do LLM Agents Do When Left Alone? Evidence of Spontaneous Meta-Cognitive Patterns\nAbstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior, establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems."}
{"text": "Title: Go With The Flow: Churn-Tolerant Decentralized Training of Large Language Models\nAbstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art. Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate."}
{"text": "Title: Evading Overlapping Community Detection via Proxy Node Injection\nAbstract: Protecting privacy in social graphs requires preventing sensitive information, such as community affiliations, from being inferred by graph analysis, without substantially altering the graph topology. We address this through the problem of \\emph{community membership hiding} (CMH), which seeks edge modifications that cause a target node to exit its original community, regardless of the detection algorithm employed. Prior work has focused on non-overlapping community detection, where trivial strategies often suffice, but real-world graphs are better modeled by overlapping communities, where such strategies fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize and address CMH in this setting. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that learns effective modification policies, including the use of proxy nodes, while preserving graph structure. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, offering a principled tool for privacy-preserving graph modification with overlapping communities."}
{"text": "Title: Learning Conformal Explainers for Image Classifiers\nAbstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions. The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions. Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts."}
{"text": "Title: From Physics to Machine Learning and Back: Part II - Learning and Observational Bias in PHM\nAbstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection, anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation, and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions, simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making. Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain generalization techniques ..."}
{"text": "Title: A Fano-Style Accuracy Upper Bound for LLM Single-Pass Reasoning in Multi-Hop QA\nAbstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed, interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable. Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods: \\faGithub \\href{https://github.com/KaiyangWan/InfoQA}{InfoQA}."}
{"text": "Title: Differential-Integral Neural Operator for Long-Term Turbulence Forecasting\nAbstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods, particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics: local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper, we propose the {\\textbf{\\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\\textbf{\\underline{I}}}ntegral {\\textbf{\\underline{N}}}eural {\\textbf{\\underline{O}}}perator (\\method{}), a novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator decomposition. \\method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This physics-based decomposition endows \\method{} with exceptional stability and robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow benchmark, we demonstrate that \\method{} significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast."}
{"text": "Title: Eigen-1: Adaptive Multi-Agent Refinement with Monitor-Based RAG for Scientific Reasoning\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden \"tool tax\" of extra tokens and steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level, integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\\% accuracy -- the highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4 points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously reducing token usage by 53.5\\% and agent steps by 43.7\\%. Results on SuperGPQA and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\\% of cases, while diversity analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation.

{"text": "Title: Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy\nAbstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \\texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection."}
{"text": "Title: Human-like Navigation in a World Built for Humans\nAbstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate efficiently in large, complex buildings."}
{"text": "Title: Adoption, usability and perceived clinical value of a UK AI clinical reference platform (iatroX): a mixed-methods formative evaluation of real-world usage and a 1,223-respondent user survey\nAbstract: Clinicians face growing information overload from biomedical literature and guidelines, hindering evidence-based care. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models may provide fast, provenance-linked answers, but requires real-world evaluation. We describe iatroX, a UK-centred RAG-based clinical reference platform, and report early adoption, usability, and perceived clinical value from a formative implementation evaluation. Methods comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over 16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent. Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active users). The survey yielded 1,223 item-level responses: perceived usefulness 86.2% (95% CI 74.8-93.9%; 50/58); would use again 93.3% (95% CI 68.1-99.8%; 14/15); recommend to a colleague 88.4% (95% CI 75.1-95.9%; 38/43); perceived accuracy 75.0% (95% CI 58.8-87.3%; 30/40); reliability 79.4% (95% CI 62.1-91.3%; 27/34). Themes highlighted speed, guideline-linked answers, and UK specificity. Early real-world use suggests iatroX can mitigate information overload and support timely answers for UK clinicians. Limitations include small per-item samples and early-adopter bias; future work will include accuracy audits and prospective studies on workflow and care quality."}

We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of null coordinates in $X^\\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a data-dependent transition $n_\\star$ (the \"elbow\"), and (ii) a universal threshold $r_\\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\\lVert \\widehat{w_p} \\rVert_r$'s which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent. This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\\ell_r$ norms within the family $r\\in [1,p]$ under $\\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows. We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By calibrating the initialization scale $\\alpha$ to an effective $p_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge between explicit and implicit bias. Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\\lVert \\widehat {w_p} \\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used."}
{"text": "Title: IntSR: An Integrated Generative Framework for Search and Recommendation\nAbstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications. However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&R) tasks. What makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R. IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&R behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%), POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%)."}
{"text": "Title: Breaking the curse of dimensionality for linear rules: optimal predictors over the ellipsoid\nAbstract: In this work, we address the following question: What minimal structural assumptions are needed to prevent the degradation of statistical learning bounds with increasing dimensionality? We investigate this question in the classical statistical setting of signal estimation from $n$ independent linear observations $Y_i = X_i^{\\top}\\theta + \\epsilon_i$. Our focus is on the generalization properties of a broad family of predictors that can be expressed as linear combinations of the training labels, $f(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}(X) Y_i$. This class -- commonly referred to as linear prediction rules -- encompasses a wide range of popular parametric and non-parametric estimators, including ridge regression, gradient descent, and kernel methods. Our contributions are twofold. First, we derive non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the generalization error for this class under the assumption that the Bayes predictor $\\theta$ lies in an ellipsoid. Second, we establish a lower bound for the subclass of rotationally invariant linear prediction rules when the Bayes predictor is fixed. Our analysis highlights two fundamental contributions to the risk: (a) a variance-like term that captures the intrinsic dimensionality of the data; (b) the noiseless error, a term that arises specifically in the high-dimensional regime. These findings shed light on the role of structural assumptions in mitigating the curse of dimensionality."}
{"text": "Title: Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy\nAbstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role."}
{"text": "Title: Inverse Reinforcement Learning Using Just Classification and a Few Regressions\nAbstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy. This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems: probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm, finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or superior performance to MaxEnt IRL."}
{"text": "Title: Fine-Tuning LLMs to Analyze Multiple Dimensions of Code Review: A Maximum Entropy Regulated Long Chain-of-Thought Approach\nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting automated code review due to their impressive capabilities in context understanding and reasoning. However, these capabilities are still limited compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model, such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model."}
{"text": "Title: Mixture of Thoughts: Learning to Aggregate What Experts Think, Not Just What They Say\nAbstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain (e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i) route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii) aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii) fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity. We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\\%$ and $+2.92\\%$, respectively. Further, MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step toward broader multi-LLM collaboration.

{"text": "Title: Distributed Specialization: Rare-Token Neurons in Large Language Models\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families, we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \\textit{distributed specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons, and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing. Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer networks."}
{"text": "Title: DATS: Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling for Calibrated Class-Incremental Learning\nAbstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective, relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS), which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches."}
{"text": "Title: WISER: Segmenting watermarked region - an epidemic change-point perspective\nAbstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models, concerns over content authenticity have led to the development of myriad watermarking schemes. These schemes can be used to detect a machine-generated text via an appropriate key, while being imperceptible to readers with no such keys. The corresponding detection mechanisms usually take the form of statistical hypothesis testing for the existence of watermarks, spurring extensive research in this direction. However, the finer-grained problem of identifying which segments of a mixed-source text are actually watermarked, is much less explored; the existing approaches either lack scalability or theoretical guarantees robust to paraphrase and post-editing. In this work, we introduce a unique perspective to such watermark segmentation problems through the lens of epidemic change-points. By highlighting the similarities as well as differences of these two problems, we motivate and propose WISER: a novel, computationally efficient, watermark segmentation algorithm. We theoretically validate our algorithm by deriving finite sample error-bounds, and establishing its consistency in detecting multiple watermarked segments in a single text. Complementing these theoretical results, our extensive numerical experiments show that WISER outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, both in terms of computational speed as well as accuracy, on various benchmark datasets embedded with diverse watermarking schemes. Our theoretical and empirical findings establish WISER as an effective tool for watermark localization in most settings. It also shows how insights from a classical statistical problem can lead to a theoretically valid and computationally efficient solution of a modern and pertinent problem."}
{"text": "Title: GRPO is Secretly a Process Reward Model\nAbstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\\lambda$-GRPO), and show that LLMs trained with $\\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on training time and cost."}
{"text": "Title: WAVECLIP: Wavelet Tokenization for Adaptive-Resolution CLIP\nAbstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings."}
{"text": "Title: CAD-Tokenizer: Towards Text-based CAD Prototyping via Modality-Specific Tokenization\nAbstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline. However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines."}
{"text": "Title: LAVA: Explainability for Unsupervised Latent Embeddings\nAbstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However, without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities (neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly distant regions of the latent spaces."}

{"text": "Title: UniSS: Unified Expressive Speech-to-Speech Translation with Your Voice\nAbstract: The ultimate goal of expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is to accurately translate spoken content while preserving the speaker identity and emotional style. However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three key challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive styles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited transfer of translation capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we address these challenges by introducing UniSS, a novel single-stage framework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing text-based LLM frameworks to develop a unified text-speech language model. To transfer translation capabilities from text to speech, we propose a cross-modal chain-of-thought prompting process that progressively aligns audio semantics with text and ensures style preservation in the decoded results. Furthermore, we construct and release a large-scale, high-quality expressive S2ST dataset, UniST, comprising 44.8k hours of data. Experimental results show that UniSS significantly outperforms previous methods in translation fidelity and speech quality while preserving voice, emotion, and duration consistency. Our work establishes a simpler and more effective paradigm for building the next generation of expressive S2ST systems. Audio samples are available at https://cmots.github.io/uniss-demo."}
{"text": "Title: Embodied Representation Alignment with Mirror Neurons\nAbstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected. Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay, treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align. Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space, where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization."}
{"text": "Title: The Unwinnable Arms Race of AI Image Detection\nAbstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible."}
{"text": "Title: ToMPO: Training LLM Strategic Decision Making from a Multi-Agent Perspective\nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose **T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18% improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities."}
{"text": "Title: Sparse Representations Improve Adversarial Robustness of Neural Network Classifiers\nAbstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA features: for both $\\ell_\\infty$ and $\\ell_2$ threat models (binary and multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\\top u$ shrink, where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity. Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together, the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the linear setting.

{"text": "Title: EvoMail: Self-Evolving Cognitive Agents for Adaptive Spam and Phishing Email Defense\nAbstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters. Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation. We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers, senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses them for future reasoning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam, SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing threats."}
{"text": "Title: RL Squeezes, SFT Expands: A Comparative Study of Reasoning LLMs\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains). Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs, and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories, whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens (about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training, with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches."}
{"text": "Title: Teaching RL Agents to Act Better: VLM as Action Advisor for Online Reinforcement Learning\nAbstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{VARL} (\\textbf{V}LM as \\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \\textbf{R}einforcement \\textbf{L}earning), a framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs) to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence. The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments."}
{"text": "Title: Expanding Reasoning Potential in Foundation Model by Learning Diverse Chains of Thought Patterns\nAbstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only 10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%."}
{"text": "Title: Physics Informed Neural Networks for design optimisation of diamond particle detectors for charged particle fast-tracking at high luminosity hadron colliders\nAbstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing. 3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order, 3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations. The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess timing degradation from electrode resistance."}
{"text": "Title: TrustJudge: Inconsistencies of LLM-as-a-Judge and How to Alleviate Them\nAbstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1) Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\\neq A). We argue that these issues come from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment. The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without requiring additional training or human annotations.

{"text": "Title: Cross-Modal Instructions for Robot Motion Generation\nAbstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot. While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm, Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via reinforcement learning."}
{"text": "Title: GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive Generalization\nAbstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app."}
{"text": "Title: Vision Transformers: the threat of realistic adversarial patches\nAbstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks, particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs. non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT) technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97% (facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs, with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model resilience to adversarial attacks."}
{"text": "Title: TyphoonMLA: A Mixed Naive-Absorb MLA Kernel For Shared Prefix\nAbstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both. TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with only a 3% overhead in HBM size."}
{"text": "Title: Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000 generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10 diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2 inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent) introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines. (2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for mitigating biases in generative LLMs."}
{"text": "Title: Recon-Act: A Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Browser-Use System via Web Reconnaissance, Tool Generation, and Task Execution\nAbstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time. The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools, thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset."}
{"text": "Title: ScaleDiff: Scaling Difficult Problems for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning\nAbstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model, which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between \"Thinking\" and \"NoThinking\" modes. We then train a specialized difficult problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a 65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500, outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code: https://github.com/QizhiPei/ScaleDiff."}
{"text": "Title: EnGraf-Net: Multiple Granularity Branch Network with Fine-Coarse Graft Grained for Classification Task\nAbstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual annotations."}
{"text": "Title: Structure-Attribute Transformations with Markov Chain Boost Graph Domain Adaptation\nAbstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization, SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task.

{"text": "Title: Disagreements in Reasoning: How a Model's Thinking Process Dictates Persuasion in Multi-Agent Systems\nAbstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning. Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making this reasoning process transparent by sharing the \"thinking content\" dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS."}
{"text": "Title: GeoRef: Referring Expressions in Geometry via Task Formulation, Synthetic Supervision, and Reinforced MLLM-based Solutions\nAbstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving. Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding."}

To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with fuel sloshing dynamics.

{"text": "Title: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training: (i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based approaches.

{"text": "Title: Combinatorial Creativity: A New Frontier in Generalization Abilities\nAbstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, marking a new frontier in generalization abilities."}
{"text": "Title: Behind RoPE: How Does Causal Mask Encode Positional Information?\nAbstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings."}
{"text": "Title: CLAUSE: Agentic Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Reasoning via Dynamic Learnable Context Engineering\nAbstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering, but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and \"think-longer\" prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack, what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices, allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline (GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints."}
{"text": "Title: SupCLAP: Controlling Optimization Trajectory Drift in Audio-Text Contrastive Learning with Support Vector Regularization\nAbstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining, which aims to unify multimodal representations in a shared embedding space, serves as a cornerstone for building a wide range of applications, from cross-modal retrieval to cutting-edge multimodal large language models. However, we find that the perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift. The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of our SVR method."}
{"text": "Title: FORCE: Transferable Visual Jailbreaking Attacks via Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction\nAbstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities. In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability, failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against closed-source MLLMs."}
{"text": "Title: Who Gets Cited Most? Benchmarking Long-Context Language Models on Scientific Articles\nAbstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and accurately locate specific information in long contexts."}
{"text": "Title: Actor-Critic without Actor\nAbstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks, which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse, multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful solution for online RL."}
{"text": "Title: Efficient Ensemble Conditional Independence Test Framework for Causal Discovery\nAbstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets."}
{"text": "Title: DELTA-Code: How Does RL Unlock and Transfer New Programming Algorithms in LLMs?\nAbstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability -- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability, we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory, compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer. Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills."}
{"text": "Title: The Use of the Simplex Architecture to Enhance Safety in Deep-Learning-Powered Autonomous Systems\nAbstract: Recently, the outstanding performance reached by neural networks in many tasks has led to their deployment in autonomous systems, such as robots and vehicles. However, neural networks are not yet trustworthy, being prone to different types of misbehavior, such as anomalous samples, distribution shifts, adversarial attacks, and other threats. Furthermore, frameworks for accelerating the inference of neural networks typically run on rich operating systems that are less predictable in terms of timing behavior and present larger surfaces for cyber-attacks. To address these issues, this paper presents a software architecture for enhancing safety, security, and predictability levels of learning-based autonomous systems. It leverages two isolated execution domains, one dedicated to the execution of neural networks under a rich operating system, which is deemed not trustworthy, and one responsible for running safety-critical functions, possibly under a different operating system capable of handling real-time constraints. Both domains are hosted on the same computing platform and isolated through a type-1 real-time hypervisor enabling fast and predictable inter-domain communication to exchange real-time data. The two domains cooperate to provide a fail-safe mechanism based on a safety monitor, which oversees the state of the system and switches to a simpler but safer backup module, hosted in the safety-critical domain, whenever its behavior is considered untrustworthy. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated by a set of experiments performed on two control systems: a Furuta pendulum and a rover. The results confirm the utility of the fall-back mechanism in preventing faults due to the learning component."}
{"text": "Title: Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Model\nAbstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities, which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge, showing that small proxies ($\\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost."}
{"text": "Title: Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning\nAbstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics, we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover, we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information removal mechanism and denoising heads."}
{"text": "Title: Automatic Red Teaming LLM-based Agents with Model Context Protocol Tools\nAbstract: The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP) tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents. Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents."}
{"text": "Title: ExMolRL: Phenotype-Target Joint Generation of De Novo Molecules via Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\nAbstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss, prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse, and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective solution for de novo drug discovery."}
{"text": "Title: RollPacker: Mitigating Long-Tail Rollouts for Fast, Synchronous RL Post-Training\nAbstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a pivotal post-training technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, synchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU underutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths within rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by relaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this paper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for synchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail responses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring that the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short rollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them into a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle time during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without sacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the benefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL stages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation and scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show that RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5 family of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs."}
{"text": "Title: Marching Neurons: Accurate Surface Extraction for Neural Implicit Shapes\nAbstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing. Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages, making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling, leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while maintaining competitive speed."}
{"text": "Title: AnywhereVLA: Language-Conditioned Exploration and Mobile Manipulation\nAbstract: We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor environments with AnywhereVLA, a modular framework for mobile manipulation. A user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\\%$ overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task generalization of language-conditioned manipulation."}
{"text": "Title: MAIFormer: Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer for Flight Trajectory Prediction\nAbstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows. However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control."}
{"text": "Title: Lossless Compression: A New Benchmark for Time Series Model Evaluation\nAbstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time series modeling."}
{"text": "Title: Feature Augmentation of GNNs for ILPs: Local Uniqueness Suffices\nAbstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme, we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired with a state-of-the-art method."}
{"text": "Title: Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models\nAbstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components (features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature extractor."}
{"text": "Title: Learning Ising Models under Hard Constraints using One Sample\nAbstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\\beta$ of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\\{-1,1\\}^n$ where each configuration $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S \\subseteq \\{-1,1\\}^n$ and has probability $\\Pr(\\mathbf{\\sigma}) \\propto \\exp(\\beta\\mathbf{\\sigma}^\\top A\\mathbf{\\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ from a truncated Ising model, with inverse parameter $\\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded degree $\\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\\hat{\\beta}$ that is $O(\\Delta^3/\\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\\beta^*$ for $k \\gtrsim \\log(d^2k)\\Delta^3.$ Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without [Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al.

{"text": "Title: Rejuvenating Cross-Entropy Loss in Knowledge Distillation for Recommender Systems\nAbstract: This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD) for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD."}
{"text": "Title: AOT*: Efficient Synthesis Planning via LLM-Empowered AND-OR Tree Search\nAbstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\\times$ fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets."}
{"text": "Title: SiNGER: A Clearer Voice Distills Vision Transformers Further\nAbstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \\oursname consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations."}
{"text": "Title: Analysis of instruction-based LLMs' capabilities to score and judge text-input problems in an academic setting\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education, LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score; Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic resources."}
{"text": "Title: Toward Robust and Efficient ML-Based GPU Caching for Modern Inference\nAbstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \\textsc{LRU} often struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further limiting practicality. We present \\textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its core algorithm, \\textsc{LARU}, enhances \\textsc{LRU} with machine-learned predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error estimation. When predictions are accurate, \\textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to near-\\textsc{LRU} performance. With \\textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching. Experiments show that \\textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\\% and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\\%, outperforming widely used inference systems.

Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance. Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively."}
{"text": "Title: CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework\nAbstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned, they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions, risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility through precise neural localization."}
{"text": "Title: An Adaptor for Triggering Semi-Supervised Learning to Out-of-Box Serve Deep Image Clustering\nAbstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining, clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image clustering methods."}
{"text": "Title: Knowledgeable Language Models as Black-Box Optimizers for Personalized Medicine\nAbstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via 'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing individualized treatments for patients."}
{"text": "Title: Dual-Path Phishing Detection: Integrating Transformer-Based NLP with Structural URL Analysis\nAbstract: Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat, undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures (e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest). Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically, the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs. The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble integration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach, establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats."}

We explored optimization of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) iterations by the TTS decoder which come at a cost of decrease in the quality of voice generated. Our experimental evaluations also demonstrate that for V-2-V implementations based on CSM most important optimizations can be brought by reducing the number of RVQ Iterations along with the codebooks used in Mimi."}
{"text": "Title: Alignment Unlocks Complementarity: A Framework for Multiview Circuit Representation Learning\nAbstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich, complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver."}
{"text": "Title: Unlocking Financial Insights: An advanced Multimodal Summarization with Multimodal Output Framework for Financial Advisory Videos\nAbstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy, multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER (Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3) aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for research.

{"text": "Title: Beyond Stars: Bridging the Gap Between Ratings and Review Sentiment with LLM\nAbstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques -- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers -- struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios."}
{"text": "Title: Flow Matching in the Low-Noise Regime: Pathologies and a Contrastive Remedy\nAbstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero, arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions, thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology, establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning."}
{"text": "Title: Decoupled-Value Attention for Prior-Data Fitted Networks: GP Inference for Physical Equations\nAbstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values. Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture, showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being over 80x faster than exact GP inference."}
{"text": "Title: CTI Dataset Construction from Telegram\nAbstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enables organizations to anticipate, detect, and mitigate evolving cyber threats. Its effectiveness depends on high-quality datasets, which support model development, training, evaluation, and benchmarking. Building such datasets is crucial, as attack vectors and adversary tactics continually evolve. Recently, Telegram has gained prominence as a valuable CTI source, offering timely and diverse threat-related information that can help address these challenges. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that systematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The pipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages from 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter threat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we compile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs. This approach not only produces a large-scale, high-fidelity CTI dataset but also establishes a foundation for future research and operational applications in cyber threat detection."}
{"text": "Title: Why Attention Fails: The Degeneration of Transformers into MLPs in Time Series Forecasting\nAbstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments, progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon, demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper underlying causes of the failure of embedding."}
{"text": "Title: Unlocking Noise-Resistant Vision: Key Architectural Secrets for Robust Models\nAbstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\\%p accuracy gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings, converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise."}
{"text": "Title: GenFacts-Generative Counterfactual Explanations for Multi-Variate Time Series\nAbstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid, implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data."}
{"text": "Title: GALAX: Graph-Augmented Language Model for Explainable Reinforcement-Guided Subgraph Reasoning in Precision Medicine\nAbstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context, and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations, and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context. Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines, which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target and pathway discovery in precision medicine."}
{"text": "Title: Conditionally Whitened Generative Models for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting\nAbstract: Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance. Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models (CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow). Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance, capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift."}
{"text": "Title: Energy saving in off-road vehicles using leakage compensation technique\nAbstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency, with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve (PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve. The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment, therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs."}
{"text": "Title: Deep Learning for Crime Forecasting: The Role of Mobility at Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Scales\nAbstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions. Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to 2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq. miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression, random forest, and standard LSTM. Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance, especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision, and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes, while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes. Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with fine-grained spatial and temporal scales."}
{"text": "Title: DeFacto: Counterfactual Thinking with Images for Enforcing Evidence-Grounded and Faithful Reasoning\nAbstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence of \"thinking with images,\" which integrates explicit visual steps into the reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases. Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual, and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive, counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace."}
{"text": "Title: FerretNet: Efficient Synthetic Image Detection via Local Pixel Dependencies\nAbstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2) decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies (LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22 generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%."}
{"text": "Title: Nuclear Diffusion Models for Low-Rank Background Suppression in Videos\nAbstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video restoration."}
{"text": "Title: Improving Early Sepsis Onset Prediction Through Federated Learning\nAbstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated, attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction, trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons, enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model. During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance (with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and organizational overhead."}
{"text": "Title: Integrating Object Interaction Self-Attention and GAN-Based Debiasing for Visual Question Answering\nAbstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets. Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods, particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in advancing VQA tasks.

{"text": "Title: On Theoretical Interpretations of Concept-Based In-Context Learning\nAbstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover, the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally, several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory."}
{"text": "Title: Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies\nAbstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution. Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance, alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for global imbalance."}
{"text": "Title: SCRA-VQA: Summarized Caption-Rerank for Augmented Large Language Models in Visual Question Answering\nAbstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%.

{"text": "Title: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning under Random Observation Delays\nAbstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays."}
{"text": "Title: StyleBench: Evaluating thinking styles in Large Language Models\nAbstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts. However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles, including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought (AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale. Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench."}
{"text": "Title: Single Answer is Not Enough: On Generating Ranked Lists with Medical Reasoning Models\nAbstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models (MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches: prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats: choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains."}
{"text": "Title: TasselNetV4: A vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting\nAbstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification. Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant. However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision, we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting, from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting."}
{"text": "Title: FHRFormer: A Self-supervised Transformer Approach for Fetal Heart Rate Inpainting and Forecasting\nAbstract: Approximately 10\\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at birth, and around 5\\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated (AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more robust risk detection."}
{"text": "Title: Actively Learning Halfspaces without Synthetic Data\nAbstract: In the classic point location problem, one is given an arbitrary dataset $X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points with query access to an unknown halfspace $f : \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\{0,1\\}$, and the goal is to learn the label of every point in $X$. This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal $\\widetilde{O}(d \\log n)$ query algorithm is known due to Hopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted the power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in fact without this power there is an $\\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to Dasgupta (NeurIPS 2004). In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning halfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound, we consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size $D$, and show tight bounds of $\\Theta(D + \\log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain an optimal $O(d + \\log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned halfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \\log n)$ vs. $\\Omega(d + \\log n)$. In fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean function $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$ provided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these orderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each ordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest. Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal algorithms for PAC-learning. We show that $O(\\min(D + \\log(1/\\varepsilon), 1/\\varepsilon) \\cdot \\log D)$ queries suffice to learn $f$ within error $\\varepsilon$, even in a setting when $f$ can be adversarially corrupted on a $c\\varepsilon$-fraction of points, for a sufficiently small constant $c$. This bound is optimal up to a $\\log D$ factor, including in the realizable setting."}
{"text": "Title: Causal Time Series Generation via Diffusion Models\nAbstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings. To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and counterfactual generation."}
{"text": "Title: Robust Multi-Omics Integration from Incomplete Modalities Significantly Improves Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease\nAbstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples, including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them. Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches, and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach."}
{"text": "Title: ImaginationPolicy: Towards Generalizable, Precise and Reliable End-to-End Policy for Robotic Manipulation\nAbstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks, multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}
{"text": "Title: Shaping Initial State Prevents Modality Competition in Multi-modal Fusion: A Two-stage Scheduling Framework via Fast Partial Information Decomposition\nAbstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state, most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking synergistic multi-modal fusion."}
{"text": "Title: Verification Limits Code LLM Training\nAbstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification, we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models."}
{"text": "Title: Security-aware Semantic-driven ISAC via Paired Adversarial Residual Networks\nAbstract: This paper proposes a novel and flexible security-aware semantic-driven integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework, namely security semantic ISAC (SS-ISAC). Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a pair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed SS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic transmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create the adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the semantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial attack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the system security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware infrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while preventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by minimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial attack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ISAC framework in terms of both SAC and eavesdropping prevention performance."}
{"text": "Title: Trustworthy Semantic Communication for Vehicular Networks: Challenges and Solutions\nAbstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has the potential to significantly reduce communication delay in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications within vehicular networks (VNs). However, the deployment of vehicular SemCom networks (VN-SemComNets) faces critical trust challenges in information transmission, semantic encoding, and communication entity reliability. This paper proposes an innovative three-layer trustworthy VN-SemComNet architecture. Specifically, we introduce a semantic camouflage transmission mechanism leveraging defensive adversarial noise for active eavesdropping defense, a robust federated encoder-decoder training framework to mitigate encoder-decoder poisoning attacks, and an audit game-based distributed vehicle trust management mechanism to deter untrustworthy vehicles. A case study validates the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. Lastly, essential future research directions are pointed out to advance this emerging field."}
{"text": "Title: Explaining Grokking and Information Bottleneck through Neural Collapse Emergence\nAbstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings on multiple datasets and architectures."}
{"text": "Title: CaTS-Bench: Can Language Models Describe Numeric Time Series?\nAbstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning. CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies, and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style. Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation models."}
{"text": "Title: T2I-Diff: fMRI Signal Generation via Time-Frequency Image Transform and Classifier-Free Denoising Diffusion Models\nAbstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform, capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution. Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification."}

Understanding How Viewers Perceive AI-Driven VTubers\nAbstract: VTubers, digital personas represented by animated avatars, have gained massive popularity. Traditionally, VTubers are operated and voiced by human controllers known as Nakanohito. The reliance on Nakanohito, however, poses risks due to potential personal controversies and operational disruptions. The emergence of AI-driven VTubers offers a new model free from these human constraints. While AI-driven VTubers present benefits such as continuous operation and reduced scandal risk, they also raise questions about authenticity and audience engagement. Therefore, to gain deeper insights, we conduct a case study, investigating viewer perceptions of Neuro-sama, the most popular AI-driven VTuber with 845k followers on Twitch and 753k followers on YouTube. We analyze 108k Reddit posts and 136k YouTube comments, aiming to better understand viewer motivations, how AI constructs the virtual persona, and perceptions of the AI as Nakanohito. Our findings enhance the understanding of AI-driven VTubers and their impact on digital streaming culture."}
{"text": "Title: Revolutionizing Precise Low Back Pain Diagnosis via Contrastive Learning\nAbstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports, LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations. These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to 95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and clinical decision support."}
{"text": "Title: Leveraging What's Overfixed: Post-Correction via LLM Grammatical Error Overcorrection\nAbstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical error correction."}
{"text": "Title: LogReasoner: Empowering LLMs with Expert-like Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning for Log Analysis Tasks\nAbstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction. However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1) coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning, then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for log analysis."}
{"text": "Title: FERD: Fairness-Enhanced Data-Free Robustness Distillation\nAbstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues, leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and (2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack (e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by 15.1\\% and 6.4\\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior performance in both robustness and fairness aspects."}
{"text": "Title: DAC-LoRA: Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum for Efficient and Robust Few-Shot Adaptation\nAbstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness."}
{"text": "Title: Aligning Inductive Bias for Data-Efficient Generalization in State Space Models\nAbstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge. One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling."}
{"text": "Title: LiLAW: Lightweight Learnable Adaptive Weighting to Meta-Learn Sample Difficulty and Improve Noisy Training\nAbstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup."}
{"text": "Title: Towards Atoms of Large Language Models\nAbstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models (LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms. Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\\ell_1$ recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features, showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs. Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability.

{"text": "Title: IConv: Focusing on Local Variation with Channel Independent Convolution for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting\nAbstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions, resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting."}
{"text": "Title: Sig2Model: A Boosting-Driven Model for Updatable Learned Indexes\nAbstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS) metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively, rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS, and uses up to 1000x less memory."}

However, current approaches face degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our ResInversion over NTI.

We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short, small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to 16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models."}

{"text": "Title: Measuring LLM Sensitivity in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis\nAbstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware. This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level."}

To address this, we propose MT-L\\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\\'evy flight. MT-L\\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage, even in complex robotics environments.

{"text": "Title: Identifying Group Anchors in Real-World Group Interactions Under Label Scarcity\nAbstract: Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship, email communication, and online Q&A. In each group, there is often a particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the questioner in a Q&A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method using information from groups both with and without known group anchors. Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using 10.2$\\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\\times$ fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average."}
{"text": "Title: Meta-Memory: Retrieving and Integrating Semantic-Spatial Memories for Robot Spatial Reasoning\nAbstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge. While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model (LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios. Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

{"text": "Title: RAPTOR-GEN: RApid PosTeriOR GENerator for Bayesian Learning in Biomanufacturing\nAbstract: Biopharmaceutical manufacturing is vital to public health but lacks the agility for rapid, on-demand production of biotherapeutics due to the complexity and variability of bioprocesses. To overcome this, we introduce RApid PosTeriOR GENerator (RAPTOR-GEN), a mechanism-informed Bayesian learning framework designed to accelerate intelligent digital twin development from sparse and heterogeneous experimental data. This framework is built on a multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph (pKG), formulated as a stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based foundational model that captures the nonlinear dynamics of bioprocesses. RAPTOR-GEN consists of two ingredients: (i) an interpretable metamodel integrating linear noise approximation (LNA) that exploits the structural information of bioprocessing mechanisms and a sequential learning strategy to fuse heterogeneous and sparse data, enabling inference of latent state variables and explicit approximation of the intractable likelihood function; and (ii) an efficient Bayesian posterior sampling method that utilizes Langevin diffusion (LD) to accelerate posterior exploration by exploiting the gradients of the derived likelihood. It generalizes the LNA approach to circumvent the challenge of step size selection, facilitating robust learning of mechanistic parameters with provable finite-sample performance guarantees. We develop a fast and robust RAPTOR-GEN algorithm with controllable error. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying regulatory mechanisms of biomanufacturing processes."}
{"text": "Title: Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational Alignment Between Vision and Language Models\nAbstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios, and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered (e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a forced-choice \"Pick-a-Pic\" task shows that human preferences for image-caption matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation."}
{"text": "Title: Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning for Zero-shot Question Answering\nAbstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning."}
{"text": "Title: AI-Enabled Crater-Based Navigation for Lunar Mapping\nAbstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration, with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform operational conditions that should be considered for future missions."}
{"text": "Title: Real-Time System for Audio-Visual Target Speech Enhancement\nAbstract: We present a live demonstration for RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system designed to run entirely on a CPU. In single-channel, audio-only settings, speech enhancement is traditionally approached as the task of extracting clean speech from environmental noise. More recent work has explored the use of visual cues, such as lip movements, to improve robustness, particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. However, to our knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated an interactive system for real-time audio-visual speech enhancement operating on CPU hardware. RAVEN fills this gap by using pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition model to encode lip movement information. The system generalizes across environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and even singing voices. In this demonstration, attendees will be able to experience live audio-visual target speech enhancement using a microphone and webcam setup, with clean speech playback through headphones."}
{"text": "Title: The Impact of Audio Watermarking on Audio Anti-Spoofing Countermeasures\nAbstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets, named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems. All related protocols are publicly available at https://github.com/Alphawarheads/Watermark_Spoofing.git"}
{"text": "Title: PALQO: Physics-informed Model for Accelerating Large-scale Quantum Optimization\nAbstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are leading strategies to reach practical utilities of near-term quantum devices. However, the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics precludes standard backpropagation, leading to prohibitive quantum resource costs when applying VQAs to large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a novel protocol that leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this dynamical system efficiently. Given a small amount of training trajectory data collected from quantum devices, our protocol predicts the parameter updates of VQAs over multiple iterations on the classical side, dramatically reducing quantum resource costs. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and reduces quantum resource costs by as much as 90\\% for tasks involving up to 40 qubits, including ground state preparation of different quantum systems, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach complements existing techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of VQAs and further strengthens their potential for practical applications."}
{"text": "Title: Imagining Design Workflows in Agentic AI Futures\nAbstract: As designers become familiar with Generative AI, a new concept is emerging: Agentic AI. While generative AI produces output in response to prompts, agentic AI systems promise to perform mundane tasks autonomously, potentially freeing designers to focus on what they love: being creative. But how do designers feel about integrating agentic AI systems into their workflows? Through design fiction, we investigated how designers want to interact with a collaborative agentic AI platform. Ten professional designers imagined and discussed collaborating with an AI agent to organise inspiration sources and ideate. Our findings highlight the roles AI agents can play in supporting designers, the division of authority between humans and AI, and how designers' intent can be explained to AI agents beyond prompts. We synthesise our findings into a conceptual framework that identifies authority distribution among humans and AI agents and discuss directions for utilising AI agents in future design workflows."}
{"text": "Title: Fairy: Interactive Mobile Assistant to Real-world Tasks via LMM-based Multi-agent\nAbstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However, existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory, achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7% and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its interaction and self-learning."}
{"text": "Title: Scaling Laws are Redundancy Laws\nAbstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations, and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations with theoretical foundations."}
{"text": "Title: A Genetic Algorithm for Navigating Synthesizable Molecular Spaces\nAbstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future."}
{"text": "Title: Beyond the Individual: Introducing Group Intention Forecasting with SHOT Dataset\nAbstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions, overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals, and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of 1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6 types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics: multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions. Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting. The dataset is available at https://xinyi-hu.github.io/SHOT_DATASET."}
{"text": "Title: Cryptographic Backdoor for Neural Networks: Boon and Bane\nAbstract: In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN) can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN. Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication; and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et. al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors, laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML)."}
{"text": "Title: CE-GPPO: Controlling Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning\nAbstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \\textbf{C}ontrolling \\textbf{E}ntropy via \\textbf{G}radient-\\textbf{P}reserving \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales."}
{"text": "Title: An Automated Retrieval-Augmented Generation LLaMA-4 109B-based System for Evaluating Radiotherapy Treatment Plans\nAbstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of radiotherapy treatment plans. Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614 radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations. Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all retrieval, prediction and checking steps. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent, scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols. Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted retrieval models to enhance real-world integration."}
{"text": "Title: Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization For Feasible Robot Motion Generation from Video Demonstrations\nAbstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints. We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics. To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to $\\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation tasks."}
{"text": "Title: Incorporating LLM Embeddings for Variation Across the Human Genome\nAbstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) embeddings have enabled powerful representations for biological data, but most applications to date focus only on gene-level information. We present one of the first systematic frameworks to generate variant-level embeddings across the entire human genome. Using curated annotations from FAVOR, ClinVar, and the GWAS Catalog, we constructed semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion possible variants and generated embeddings at three scales: 1.5 million HapMap3+MEGA variants, ~90 million imputed UK Biobank variants, and ~9 billion all possible variants. Embeddings were produced with both OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large and the open-source Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B models. Baseline experiments demonstrate high predictive accuracy for variant properties, validating the embeddings as structured representations of genomic variation. We outline two downstream applications: embedding-informed hypothesis testing by extending the Frequentist And Bayesian framework to genome-wide association studies, and embedding-augmented genetic risk prediction that enhances standard polygenic risk scores. These resources, publicly available on Hugging Face, provide a foundation for advancing large-scale genomic discovery and precision medicine."}
{"text": "Title: Learning to Align Molecules and Proteins: A Geometry-Aware Approach to Binding Affinity\nAbstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening. While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark, as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation. Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust drug-target affinity prediction."}
